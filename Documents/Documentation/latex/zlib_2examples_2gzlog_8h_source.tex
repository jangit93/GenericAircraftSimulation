00027 \textcolor{comment}{                     Interface changed slightly in that now path is a prefix}

00029 \textcolor{comment}{                     gzlog\_write() now always leaves the log file as valid gzip}
00030 \textcolor{comment}{   2.1   8 Jul 2012  Fix argument checks in gzlog\_compress() and gzlog\_write()}
00031 \textcolor{comment}{   2.2  14 Aug 2012  Clean up signed comparisons}

00035 \textcolor{comment}{   The gzlog object allows writing short messages to a gzipped log file,}
00036 \textcolor{comment}{   opening the log file locked for small bursts, and then closing it.  The log}
00037 \textcolor{comment}{   object works by appending stored (uncompressed) data to the gzip file until}
00038 \textcolor{comment}{   1 MB has been accumulated.  At that time, the stored data is compressed, and}
00039 \textcolor{comment}{   replaces the uncompressed data in the file.  The log file is truncated to}
00040 \textcolor{comment}{   its new size at that time.  After each write operation, the log file is a}
00041 \textcolor{comment}{   valid gzip file that can decompressed to recover what was written.}

00043 \textcolor{comment}{   The gzlog operations can be interupted at any point due to an application or}
