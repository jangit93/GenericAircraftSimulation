00025 ## 1.0 Introduction
00026 Matio is an open-source C library for reading and writing binary MATLAB MAT files.
00027 This library is designed for use by programs/libraries that do not have access or do not want to rely
       on MATLAB's shared libraries.

00053 
00054 ## 2.0 Building
00055 This section describes how to build matio. Section [2.1](#21-dependencies) describes the dependencies,
       Section [2.2](#22-building-matio) how to build/test matio, and Section [2.3](#23-platforms) documents the
       platforms matio has been tested on.
00056 
00057 ### 2.1 Dependencies
00058 Matio has two optional dependencies. These are not required for the software to work, but without them
       some files may be unreadable. Zlib is required to read/write level 5 MAT files that use compression. HDF5
       is required to work with newer MAT files that use the HDF5-format files.
00059 
00060 #### 2.1.1 zlib
00061 To support compressed MAT files, zlib version &ge; 1.2.3 is required. The zlib software can be
       downloaded from http://zlib.net/.
00062 
00063 #### 2.1.2 HDF5
00064 Support for MAT file version 7.3 requires the HDF5 library. This library can be downloaded from
       https://www.hdfgroup.org/. Matio requires HDF5 version &ge; 1.8.x. Neither deprecated HDF5 1.6.x API functions nor
       HDF5 higher-level functions are called.
00065 
00066 * Building matio with HDF5 1.8.x requires configuration of HDF5 with default API version 1.8 (i.e.
       `--with-default-api-version=v18`).
00067 * Building matio with HDF5 1.10.x requires configuration of HDF5 with either default API version 1.10
       (i.e. `--with-default-api-version=v110`) or with deprecated API version 1.8 (i.e.
       `--with-default-api-version=v18`).
00068 
00069 For Windows, the pre-compiled binaries can be used which also include a DLL of zlib to satisfy the
       zlib dependency.
00070 
00071 ### 2.2 Building matio
00072 #### 2.2.1 Quick Build Guide
00073 The primary method for building the software is using `configure` followed by `make`. After building,
       the testsuite can be executed to test the software using `make check`. The software can be installed using
       `make install`. For example,
00074 ```sh
00075 git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/matio/matio
00076 cd matio
00077 git submodule update --init  # for datasets used in unit tests
00078 ./autogen.sh
00079 ./configure
00080 make
00081 make check
00082 make install
00083 ```
00084 If any of the tests in the testsuite fail, you should report the failure using the tracker (see
       Section [1.4](#14-questions-and-reporting-bugs)). You should attach the generated testsuite.log file to the bug
       report.
00085 
00086 #### 2.2.2 Configure Options
00087 The configure script used to build the software takes a number of options. This section describes the
       key options.
00088 
00089 * `--enable-mat73=yes`
00090 This flag en/disables the support for version 7.3 MAT files. The option only makes sense if built with
       HDF5 as support for version 7.3 files. It will be disabled if HDF5 is not available.
00091 * `--enable-extended-sparse=yes`
00092 Enable extended sparse matrix data types not supported in MATLAB. MATLAB only supports
       double-precision sparse data. With this flag, matio will read sparse data with other types (i.e. single-precision and
       integer types).
00093 * `--with-matlab=DIR`
00094 This option specifies the directory (DIR) with the 'matlab' program. With this option, the testsuite
       will check that the MAT files written by matio can be read into MATLAB. Without this, the test will only
       check that matio can read the file written and if successful the test will be skipped. If matio can not read the
       file, the test will fail.
00095 * `--with-zlib=DIR`
00096 This option specifies the prefix where zlib is installed (see Section [2.1.1](#211-zlib) for
       information about zlib).
00097 * `--with-hdf5=DIR`
00098 This option specifies the prefix where the HDF5 software is installed (see Section [2.1.2](#212-hdf5)
       for information about HDF5).
00099 * `--with-default-file-ver=version`
00100 This option sets the default MAT file version (4,5,7.3) that will be used when writing. The default
       file version is used by the Mat\_Create macro and the Mat\_CreateVer function when MAT\_FT\_DEFAULT is used for
       the version argument.
00101 * `--with-libdir-suffix=suffix`
00102 This option specifies a suffix to apply to library directories when installing and looking for
       dependent libraries (i.e. HDF5 and zlib). For example, some multi-arch Linux distributions install 64-bit libraries
       into lib64 and 32-bit libraries into lib.
00103 
00104 #### 2.2.3 Visual Studio
00105 Visual Studio solutions are provided as [matio\_vs2008.sln](visual\_studio/matio\_vs2008.sln) for VS2008
       and as [matio.sln](visual\_studio/matio.sln) for VS2010 (and newer). The solutions are set up to build a DLL
       of the matio library (libmatio.dll) and matdump tool and assume HDF5 is available in the directory specified
       by the HDF5\_DIR environment variable. It is assumed that the **shared** libraries of HDF5 (and zlib) are
       available. If the **static** libraries of HDF5 (and zlib) are installed/built the macro
       `H5\_BUILT\_AS\_STATIC\_LIB` needs to be defined (instead of `H5\_BUILT\_AS\_DYNAMIC\_LIB`).
00106 
00107 * The VS2008 solution was tested with Visual Studio 2008 and the [HDF5 1.8.12 Visual Studio pre-built
       Windows binaries](https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.8/hdf5-1.8.12/bin/windows/)
       (vs9shared) including zlib.
00108 * The VS2010 solution was tested with Visual Studio 2010 and the [HDF5 1.8.13 Visual Studio pre-built
       Windows binaries](https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.8/hdf5-1.8.13/bin/windows/)
       (VS2010-shared) including zlib.
00109 * The updated VS2010 solution was tested with Visual Studio 2015 and the [HDF5 1.8.16 Visual Studio
       pre-built Windows
       binaries](https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.8/hdf5-1.8.16/bin/windows/extra/) (vs2015-shared) including zlib.
00110 
00111 #### 2.2.4 Testsuite
00112 A testsuite is available when building with the GNU autotools. To run the testsuite, first configure
       and build matio. After building run `make check` to run the testsuite. If matio was built without zlib, the
       compressed variable tests will be skipped. If built without HDF5, the tests for version 7.3 MAT files will be
       skipped. If the path to the MATLAB application was not specified (`--with-matlab`), the write tests will
       fail if matio cannot read the file and skip if matio can read the file. The write tests will pass if MATLAB is
       available and can also read the file.
00113 
00114 To report matio testsuite failures, compress the testsuite.log file in the test sub-directory of the
       build directory. Upload the compressed log file along with a bug report (see Section
       [1.4](#14-questions-and-reporting-bugs) for information on reporting bugs).
00115 
00116 ### 2.3 Platforms
00117 The library has been tested/used on Linux, Windows, OS X, and AIX including both little-endian and
       big-endian architecture.
