Swap the layout from col-\/major to row-\/major, or row-\/major to col-\/major, and invert the order of the dimensions.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$Tensor\+Layout\+Swap.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Swap the layout from col-\/major to row-\/major, or row-\/major to col-\/major, and invert the order of the dimensions. 

Beware\+: the dimensions are reversed by this operation. If you want to preserve the ordering of the dimensions, you need to combine this operation with a shuffle.
